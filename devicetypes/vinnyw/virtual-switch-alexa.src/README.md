# Virtual Switch (Alexa)
This is Device Handler for a composite Virtual Switch.  This device operates like a Switch but also has the characteristics of a Contact Sensor (Open/Close).  The switch will behave and act like a normal switch, however is not attached to a physical device.  It can be controlled, like any other device, via the SmartThings mobile app or Automations.  

The Contact Sensor can be used by other systems that do not directly support Switch events.  

The device will raise the following events for each state:


| State        | Switch       | Contact      |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Off          | Off          | Open *       |
| On           | On           | Closed       |


> The Amazon Echo platform does not recognise events raised by a switch. This means that switches cannot be used to trigger routines.  Currently only Motion Sensors and Contact Sensors are recognised as Smart Home triggers.

\* only if auto reset is disabled 


## Installation 
Install and publish the Device Handler in the usual way via the SmartThings IDE.   
Create a new device in the SmartThings IDE and assign the Device Handler to it. 

> When the device is installed or updated it will set its state to the *Off* position


## Parameters

### Auto Reset?
When this setting is enabled the device will revert back to an *Off* state after 1 second (approximate) . 

In this mode the device can be used as a poor manâ€™s momentary press button by always returning to the default *Off* state.


### Ignore State?
When this setting is enabled the device will always raise an event, even if the device is already in the requested state.

The default behaviour (when disabled) is to only raise an event when the status of the device actually changes value.  

Scenes and Automations to not check the status of a device before sending a status command.  This will allow automations to be triggered multiple times by the same device state.


### Debug Log?
When this setting is enabled the device will write running information, debug messages and errors to the Live Logging console available via the SmartThings Web IDE.

The default behaviour (when disabled) is to only log critical errors to the Live Logging console.
